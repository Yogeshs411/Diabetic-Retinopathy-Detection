# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection
Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a severe complication of diabetes that affects the eyes, leading to vision 
impairment and blindness if left untreated. Diabetic Retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness in 
the working age population of the developed world. World health organisation estimates that 347 million
people have this disease worldwide. Early detection of DR is crucial for timely intervention and 
preventing irreversible damage. In this study, we propose a robust approach for diabetic retinopathy 
detection leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Residual Networks (ResNet) with 
Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation functions. Our methodology involves the utilization of a deep 
learning framework to analyze retinal images and accurately classify the severity of diabetic retinopathy. 
The CNN architecture serves as the foundation, extracting hierarchical features from the input images, 
The integration of ResNet architecture further facilitates the training of deeper networks, addressing the 
challenges of vanishing gradients and accelerating convergence. The choice of ReLU activation 
functions enhances the network's non-linearity, enabling more effective modeling of complex 
relationships within the data.

# System Requirements
A computer system with a modern operating system capable of running the necessary
software tools. High-speed internet connection for downloading datasets and software tools.A CPU with multiple cores for parallel processing. A substantial amount of RAM (16GB or more) to handle large datasets. A dedicated Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is often required for constructing and evaluating deep learning models. Operating System: Most deep learning frameworks are compatible with major operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS).
• Python: A high-level programming language commonly used in AI/ML.
• Libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch for building and training ML models.
• Libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.
• Jupyter Notebook or similar IDE for writing and executing code

APTOS Dataset :
The APTOS (Asia Pacific Tele-Ophthalmology Society) dataset is a comprehensive collection of 
retinal images used for detecting diabetic retinopathy. It was introduced as part of the APTOS 
2019 Blindness Detection competition on Kaggle, aiming to leverage machine learning to 
improve diagnosis accuracy.
